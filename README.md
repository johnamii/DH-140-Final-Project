# DH-140-Final-Project

In considering my final project for DH 140, I've had lots of ideas which will be recounted below. In the exploration process, I've pondered a wide range of topics. I started this by finding some interesting datasets around music, and visualizations related to them.

## Data and viz of interest
[A peep at the current state of jazz music through data from Spotify - George Tsang - Medium](https://tsanggeorge.medium.com/a-peep-at-the-current-state-of-jazz-music-through-data-from-spotify-part0-75400069f2dc)

> I'm interested in this article specifically because it uses the popular Spotify API to analyze jazz music's popularity by broad listenership. That's a great intersection of my interests.

> This was another data-driven use case of the Spotify API, and this was one of multiple interesting visualizations of the creator's own listening history.

Next, I widened my scope into broader topics and searched more for specific datasets.

## Ideas to Investigate
### Topics of interest
* Music / Musicology

Finally, I expanded my search into the realm of pre-curated datasets and collections, for further ideas on what data might be fun to explore.

## Ideas from curated datasets & project lists

| Dataset Name | Description | Hyperlink |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NY Phil Performance History | The data includes information about every NY Phil performance ever, including info about date, venue, program, and more. Coding could be useful to explore the data efficiently and automatically find patterns within it. | [NY Phil Data](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory/?tab=readme-ov-file) |
| Apartment for Rent Classified | This data includes a bunch of apartment listings across the United States. It would be very cool to use python to make a geographic analysis and visualization of cost of living trends across the country. | [Apartment Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified) |
